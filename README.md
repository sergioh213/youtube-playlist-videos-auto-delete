# youtube-playlist-videos-auto-delete
A bit of code that you can run on your browser's console if you are on a Youtube's playlist page, and it will automatically delete videos from top to bottom.

Useful as of the creation of this repository because Youtube removed the option to delete all videos at once. And some playlists can't be deleted. So you have to go one by one... Or automate it with this YEYYYYYY.

I'm guessing it won't work if they updated the UI. Although I'm using pretty generic class names for the selectors.
